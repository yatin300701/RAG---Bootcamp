JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming 
language that powers the interactive behavior of modern web pages.
 It runs directly in the browser, allowing developers 
 to manipulate HTML and CSS in real time, handle user 
 events, and communicate with servers without reloading 
 the page. Beyond browsers, JavaScript is also used on 
 the server side through platforms like Node.js, making 
 it a full-stack language. With its dynamic typing, 
 first-class functions, and asynchronous features like 
 Promises and async/await, JavaScript provides both 
 flexibility and power for building responsive, 
 scalable web applications.
